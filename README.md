# Next.js CSR and SSR Rendering Demo

This repository demonstrates Client-Side Rendering (CSR) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) methods in Next.js.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to showcase the differences between CSR and SSR and their implementations within a Next.js application. Each commit in this repository represents a step in the process, allowing developers to follow the progression and understand how each rendering method is integrated.

## How to See the Progress

Developers can explore the different rendering methods by checking out previous commits. To reverse the commits and see the project's evolution, you can use the following git commands:

1.  **View commit history:**
    ```bash
    git log
    ```

2.  **Checkout a specific commit:**
    ```bash
    git checkout <commit-hash>
    ```

By moving through the commits, you can observe the implementation of:

*   Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
*   Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

## Getting Started

To run the application at any stage, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd my-app
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Feel free to explore the code and the commit history to gain a deeper understanding of CSR and SSR in Next.js.
